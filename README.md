# Open Digital Protest Protocol (ODPP)

## 1. Purpose & Vision

The Open Digital Protest Protocol (ODPP) defines a **non-violent, anonymous, visual-first method** for expressing political stances in a digital environment.

Its purpose is **not debate, persuasion, or mobilization**, but the **aggregation and visualization of otherwise unheard voices**, especially from individuals who face social, psychological, or structural barriers to participation in offline demonstrations.

ODPP is designed as a **protocol, not a service**. Any organization, community, or developer may implement it independently.

---

## 2. Scope & Constraints

* **Issue Scope**: Domestic political and social issues only
* **Language**: Japanese
* **Eligibility**: Residents within Japan
* **Non-goals**:

  * No calls for violence
  * No recruitment or organization of real-world actions
  * No threaded discussions or debates

These constraints are intentional and serve as **security, safety, and de-escalation measures**, not ideological limitations.

---

## 3. Core Principles

1. **Non-violence by design**
   Expression is symbolic and visual; no operational coordination is possible.

2. **Symmetry of positions**
   All issues must allow both support and opposition under identical conditions.

3. **Anonymity with minimal accountability**
   Users are not identifiable, yet duplicate participation is discouraged.

4. **Limited expressiveness**
   Constraints on text length and representation reduce escalation and abuse.

5. **Visualization over amplification**
   ODPP prioritizes collective visibility rather than individual virality.

## 4. Participation Flow (Mandatory)

### Step 1: Position Selection

Participants must choose one of the following positions:

* **Support**
* **Oppose**

Results are displayed as a **real-time visual bar indicator**, representing relative proportions rather than precise vote counts.

---

### Step 2: Avatar Selection

Participants select an avatar from a predefined set provided by the implementation.

Avatar design guidelines:

* Politically neutral by default
* Copyright-safe
* Categories may include:

  * Serious / formal
  * Humorous / light-hearted
  * Stylized heroes (non-derivative)
  * Anthropomorphized animals

Each avatar includes **3–4 static images or short looping animations**.

The final state displays a **speech-bubble-style overlay** containing the participant’s statement.

---

### Step 3: Handle Name

* Up to **10 characters**
* Must not be a real name
* Used only within a single issue context

The handle name exists to provide **minimal continuity**, not identity.

The protocol prioritizes **one-expression-per-person-per-issue**, not persistent personas.

---

### Step 4: Statement Text

* Maximum **80 characters**
* Plain text only
* No images, links, or emojis

The statement is visually bound to the selected avatar.

This limitation is intentional to emphasize **stance over rhetoric**.

---

## 5. Optional Attributes (Strongly Recommended as Optional)

The following attributes may be requested **optionally** and must be:

* Voluntary
* Stored anonymously
* Used only for **aggregated statistical visualization**

### Optional Attributes

* Gender: Male / Female / Non-binary
* Age group: U18 / 18–39 / 40–64 / 65+
* Region: One of 8 predefined domestic regions

These attributes **must not be required** for participation.

---

## 6. Visualization Rules

* No ranking of individual statements
* No highlighting of extreme positions
* No algorithmic promotion

All visualizations should reinforce the idea of **collective presence**, not competition.

---

## 7. Abuse Prevention & Moderation Philosophy

ODPP does not rely on punitive moderation.

Core approach:

* Structural limitations over behavioral enforcement
* Short text limits reduce harassment
* No reply or quote functionality

AI-assisted moderation may be used **only** to:

* Detect explicit threats
* Remove hate speech
* Enforce length and format rules

No ideological filtering is permitted.

---

## 8. Security & Risk Awareness

The protocol is intentionally designed to:

* Avoid geopolitical targeting
* Minimize coordinated manipulation
* Reduce incentives for mass harassment

Domestic-only scope is a **defensive design choice**, not a political stance.

---

## 9. Open Source & Licensing

ODPP is intended to be released under a **permissive open-source license** (e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0).

No central authority governs implementations.

Forking, localization, and modification are explicitly encouraged, provided that the **core principles are preserved**.

---

## 10. Final Note

ODPP is not a platform for shouting louder.

It is a protocol for **being counted without being exposed**.

The protocol exists so that participation itself becomes visible—without demanding courage, charisma, or conformity.
